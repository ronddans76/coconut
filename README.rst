Coconut
=======

*Coconut is a variant of Python built for simple, elegant functional programming.*

Python is a beautiful, powerful language. Unfortunately, much of that beauty goes away when programming in a functional style. This is because Python was built to be an object-oriented programming language, object-oriented use cases the most heavily considered in the design of the language. While functional programming in Python technically works, it's cumbersome and difficult. Coconut is the solution to that problem, a functional-programming-focused language that compiles to Python.
