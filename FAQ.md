## Why the name Coconut?

![Monty Python and the Holy Grail](http://i.imgur.com/PoFot.jpg)

If you don't get the reference, the image above is from [Monty Python and the Holy Grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail), in which the Knights of the Round Table bang Coconuts together to mimic the sound of riding a horse. The name was chosen to reference the fact that [Python is named after Monty Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/) as well.

## If I'm already perfectly happy with Python, why should I learn Coconut?

You're exactly the person Coconut was built for! Coconut lets you keep doing the thing you do well—write Python—without having to worry about annoyances like version compatibility, while also allowing you to do new cool things you might never have thought were possible before like pattern-matching and lazy evaluation. If you've ever used a functional programming language before, you'll know that functional code is often much simpler, cleaner, and more readable (but not always, which is why Coconut isn't purely functional). Python is a wonderful imperative language, but when it comes to modern functional programming—which, in Python's defense, it wasn't desined for—Python falls short, and Coconut corrects that shortfall.

## I don't like functional programming, should I still use Coconut?

Yes, absolutely! While Coconut is great for functional programming, it also has a bunch of other awesome features as well, including the ability to compile Python 3 code into universal Python code that will run the same on _any version_. And that's not even mentioning all of the features like pattern-matching and destructuring assignment with utility extending far beyond just functional programming.

## I don't know Python very well, should I try to learn Coconut?

Maybe. If you only know the very basics of Python, but are also very familiar with functional programming, then definitely—Coconut will let you continue to use all your favorite tools of functional programming while you make your way through learning Python. If you're not very familiar either with Python, or with functional programming, then you may be better making your way through a Python tutorial before you try learning Coconut. That being said, using Coconut to compile your pure Python code might still be very helpful for you, since it will alleviate having to worry about version incompatibility.

## Why isn't Coconut purely functional?

Coconut isn't purely functional for the same reason Python was never purely imperative—different problems demand different approaches. Coconut is built to be fundamentally useful, and that means not imposing constraints about what style the programmer should be using. That being said, Coconut is built specifically to work really well when programming in a functional style, which means if you want to write all your code purely functionally, Coconut will make it a smooth experience, and allow you to have good-looking code to show for it.

## Won't a spin-off language like Coconut be bad for the Python community?

I certainly hope not! Unlike the sort of spin-off language you might be thinking about, all valid Python is valid Coconut. Coconut's goal isn't to replace Python, but to _extend_ it. If a newbie learns Coconut, it won't mean they have a harder time learning Python, it'll mean they _already know_ Python. And not just any Python, the newest and greatest—Python 3. And of course, Coconut is perfectly interoperable with Python, and uses all the same libraries—thus, Coconut can't split the Python community, because the Coconut community _is_ the Python community.

## I want to contribute to Coconut, how do I get started?

That's great! Coconut is completely open-source, and new contributors are always welcome. Contributing to Coconut is as simple as forking Coconut on [GitHub](https://github.com/evhub/coconut), making your changes, and proposing a pull request. If you have any questions at all about contributing, including understanding the source code, figuring out how to implement a specific change, or just trying to figure out what needs to be done, try asking around at Coconut's [Gitter](https://gitter.im/evhub/coconut), a GitHub-integrated chatroom for Coconut developers.

## Who developed Coconut?

[Evan Hubinger](https://github.com/evhub) is an undergraduate student studying computer science at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/).
