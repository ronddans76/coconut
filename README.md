CoconutScript
=============

CoconutScript is a modern, developer-friendly scripting language that compiles to Python, built for functional programming.

CoconutScript is still in the early stages of development, and no stable release is currently available. If CoconutScript sounds interesting to you, however, we recommend you check back later when a stable release is available, or check out CoconutScript's spiritual predecessor, [Rabbit](https://github.com/evhub/rabbit).
